# notify-me
Send me a notification (Pushover, email, sms, etc) when conditions in a script are met

I sometimes wants to be notified when:
  - a server is down or a port is closed on a specific IP
  - a machine is running low is diskspace
  - a certain phrase is found on a website
  - a plane ticket costs X$ to Japan

... you get the idea

To me, Nagios, Zabbix, etc are overkill for this. 
I just want to be able to write a quick python script, and when the conditions in the script are met, send me a notification on the specific channel I've specified.
